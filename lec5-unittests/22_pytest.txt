# simply test using pytest, a third party tool
# pytest automates the testing process
# pytest only tests function given in test file, not all the logic in main
# it's better to break up your ideas into smaller bite-sized functions that are testable, like square(n)
# check50 is a harvard specific alternative to pytest
# if one test fails it stops other tests from beinig run
# because of this, it's better to break u one big test into multiple smaller tests by category

When you use the assertion keyword and it fails, it will be raised in python as an AssertionError

# tests MUST have side effects or must return a value in order to work
